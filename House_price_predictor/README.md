# üè† House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the development of a **machine learning model** using **Linear Regression** to predict the price of a house based on various features, such as **location**, **size**, **number of rooms**, **amenities**, and more.

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ Predict house prices based on multiple factors  
‚úÖ Uses **Linear Regression** for continuous variable prediction  
‚úÖ Takes into account multiple **predictor features** such as:
- Location
- Size (square footage)
- Number of rooms
- Amenities (e.g., parking, garden)
- Year of construction
- And more‚Ä¶

## üîß How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The model takes in data such as the size, location, number of rooms, and other relevant features of a house.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
3. **Model Training**: The **Linear Regression** model is trained on the dataset, learning the relationships between the house features and its price.
4. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model predicts house prices for new data based on the learned relationships.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** or **R-squared (R¬≤)**.
